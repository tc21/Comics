# Comics
We're making an iTunes for comics! We're actually making an iTunes for everything. Isn't that what iTunes already is? Anyway, the idea is that we're making an iTunes that can be customized for anything, where you define the "title", "artist", "genre", "way to listen", "album art" for each "song", and of course with multiple libraries.
